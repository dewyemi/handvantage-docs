# Handvantage Marketing Assets: High-Ticket Home Services Niche

## 1. Cold Email Sequence (Target: HVAC/Plumbing Owners)

### Email 1: The "Missed Revenue" Hook
**Subject:** Missed calls yesterday?

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I called a few HVAC companies in [City] yesterday after hours, and almost everyone went to voicemail.

It got me thinking—how many $5,000+ install jobs are you losing every month just because the phone rang when you were busy or sleeping?

I run Handvantage, an AI receptionist that answers your phone 24/7, qualifies the lead ("Is your AC completely out?"), and books the appointment directly on your calendar. It sounds exactly like a human.

Open to a 3-minute demo to hear it in action?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email 2: The "Competitor" Nudge (Follow-up)
**Subject:** Your competitors are sleeping

**Body:**

[Name],

Quick follow-up.

Most of your competitors in [City] are still using voicemail or expensive answering services that just take messages.

If you install Handvantage, you become the *only* business that answers instantly at 11 PM on a Sunday when a pipe bursts. You win the job by default.

Here’s a link to hear a sample call: [Link]

Worth a chat?

## 2. Cold Call Script (Gatekeeper & Owner)

**Opener:**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with Handvantage. I’m not looking to sell you SEO or leads. I’m calling because I see you guys are running ads, but I’m betting you’re missing calls when your crew is out on jobs. Is that fair to say?"

**The Pitch:**
"We built an AI employee that lives in your phone system. It answers every call instantly—24/7—talks to the customer just like a human, filters out the tire kickers, and books the paying jobs straight to your calendar. It costs less than a daily coffee."

**The Close:**
"I don't want you to take my word for it. Can I text you a number right now so you can call it and try to 'trick' the AI yourself?"

## 3. Facebook/LinkedIn Ad Copy

**Headline:** Stop Losing $10k Jobs to Voicemail.

**Visual:** A split screen. Left side: "Competitors" (Sleeping, phone ringing). Right side: "You" (AI answering, booking notification popping up).

**Copy:**

Your voicemail is costing you a fortune. 💸

Every time a customer calls with an emergency and gets your voicemail, they hang up and call the next guy on Google. That’s a $5,000 job gone in 10 seconds.
