## The Problem (Agitation)
**Headline:** Your Voicemail is Where Leads Go to Die.
**Body:**
In the home service industry, speed is everything. If a customer has a burst pipe or a broken AC, they don't leave a voicemail—they call your competitor.
*   **67% of customers hang up** if they get sent to voicemail.
*   **Every missed call** is a potential $500 - $15,000 job lost.
*   **Hiring human receptionists** is expensive, hard to manage, and they can't work 24/7.
